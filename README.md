# Plex Party

A fork of [Netflix party](https://github.com/netflixparty1/netflixparty-chrome) to support plex

Plex Party is a Chrome extension for watching Plex remotely with friends, e.g., for movie nights with that long-distance special someone. It synchronizes video playback and adds group chat.

This is the Chrome extension. The source for the server can be found [here](https://github.com/boyers/netflixparty-server).
